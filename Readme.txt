##Rick & Morty API

This project objective is to show the data that is available in the Rick and Morty API.

This project will be using: TailwindCSS and TypeScript.



#The organization and developing of the project was guided by the following steps:

1. We read the documentation and requeriments and decided what features and pages we were going to implement.
    - On this point we decided to do all the extras since we felt capable to do it in time.
2. We designed and implemented the layout of all the pages that were needed.
3. We designed and coded the functions and types involved in the API requests.
4. We designed and coded the functions that involved printing HTML elements and handling events.
5. We improved our code by organizing it in diferents sheets, implement removeEventListeners, adding extra functions to reuse code and other actions recomended by good practices.
    - In this point we experimented some issues with the exports sintax with TypeScript, but after some research we could manage it.
6. We added responsive layout to the project.
7. Fixed minor bugs like html render problems or TS typing problems.
